Dataset Summary
The dataset documents the growth behavior of microalgae cultures (A. platensis, C. asymmetrica, S. obliquus; each of them as their wildtype and an adapted strain) under different concentrations of "exhaust gas medium" (medium that is saturated with exhaust gas from natural gas combustion). It includes data from exhaust gas analysis, pH and OD measurements, daily culture images, and extracted RGB values. The dataset was created to study the impact of exhaust gas components on microalgae growth, supporting research in CO₂ sequestration. The collected data enables modeling of growth trends and identifying lethal concentrations. It will also help showing the effectiveness of adapting the strains to a harsh environment.

Supported Tasks and Applications
Image-Based Analysis: Parts of the dataset can be included in the correlation between concentration and color saturation.

Languages
The dataset does not involve language-specific text. The accompanying documentation is in English.

Dataset Structure
Data Instances
A typical data instance consists of the following components:
Exhaust Gas Data: CSV file with columns for gas composition and measurement timestamps.
pH and OD Data: Excel file containing manually entered pH and OD measurements for each experimental phase.
Images: JPG or PNG files documenting daily culture growth, named with standardized conventions.
RGB Data: Excel file with extracted mean RGB values calculated from images using ImageJ.

Dataset Creation
Curation Rationale
This dataset will be used to provide a resource for analyzing microalgae growth patterns under varying environmental conditions. It supports research in CO₂ reduction, by integrating measurements from multiple data types (e.g., gas analysis, imaging).

Source Data
Initial Data Collection:
Gas data was automatically recorded from analytical devices in CSV format.
pH and OD values were manually entered into structured Excel templates.
Images were captured using a digital camera with a standardized naming convention.
mean RGB values were extracted using ImageJ and manually recorded in Excel.

Who are the source producers?
The data was produced by laboratory staff involved in the controlled cultivation of microalgae, following established protocols to ensure sterility.

Annotations
The dataset does not include additional annotations.

Personal and Sensitive Information
No personal or sensitive information is included in the dataset. All data is scientific and pertains exclusively to the growth behavior of microalgae cultures.

Considerations for Using the Data

Known Limitations
The dataset captures controlled laboratory conditions and may not reflect microalgae growth behavior in open systems or natural environments.
