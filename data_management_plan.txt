1. Description of Data Collection and Types
Data Sources:
Exhaust Gas Analysis: CSV files
Gas Measurements: CSV files
pH Measurements: Manual entry into Excel
OD Values at 750 nm: Manual entry into Excel
Daily Culture Images: Image files in JPG or PNG format
Average RGB Values: Manually extracted using ImageJ and saved in Excel
Data Formats:
Tabular Data: CSV, Excel (.xlsx)
Image Data: JPG or PNG
Measurement Points:
pH Values: At the start and end of the experiment
OD Values: At the start, end, and during the experiment for daily RGB image analysis
RGB Values: Three times daily during the experimental phase

2. Data Collection
Data Sources:
Exhaust Gas Analysis: Automatically saved as CSV files by analytical devices.
pH and OD Values: Manually entered into preformatted Excel files.
Image Data: Captured using a digital camera, with images saved using standardized filenames.
RGB Values: Calculated using ImageJ, with results recorded in Excel.
Documentation:
A laboratory notebook will be maintained to log all measurement activities, anomalies, and observations.

3. Data Organization
Folder Structure:
Main Folder: Microalgae_Growth
Subfolders:
01_Exhaust_Gas_Analysis
02_pH_OD_Measurements
03_Images
04_RGB_Values
05_Analysis
File Naming Conventions:
Images: YYYYMMDD_CultureName_Concentration.jpg (e.g., 20250119_A_platensis_50.jpg)
Exhaust Gas Data: ExhaustAnalysis_CultureName_Date.csv
Gas Measurements: GasMeasurement_CO2_Date.csv
Excel Files: ExperimentData_Microalgae.xlsx

4. Storage and Backup
Storage Locations:
Primary Storage: Local laboratory computer with secured access.
Secondary Storage: Cloud backup (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive).
Backup Strategy:
Daily backups of all data to an external server or hard drive.
Access Rights:
Access restricted to authorized team members.
Write access limited to the principal investigator.

5. Data Protection and Ethical Considerations
No personal data is collected, so specific data protection requirements are not applicable.
Results are purely scientific and intended for publication in academic journals.

6. Data Analysis
Tools:
Tabular Data: Microsoft Excel for pH and OD values.
Image Analysis: ImageJ for RGB analysis.
Statistical Analysis: R or Python for modeling growth data.
Analysis Documentation:
All analysis steps will be documented in scripts to ensure reproducibility.

7. Long-Term Archiving
Archiving Strategy:
Store key results and raw data in a long-term data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare).
Retention Period:
Data will be archived for at least 10 years.
Data Formats for Archiving:
Tabular Data: CSV (machine-readable and sustainable).
Images: PNG (lossless compression).

8. Data Sharing
Data Release:
Selected datasets will be shared via a public repository (e.g., Zenodo, Dryad) after publication.
License:
Data will be shared under the CC BY 4.0 license, permitting reuse with attribution to the authors.

9. Responsibilities
Principal Investigator:
Primary responsibility for data collection, storage, and sharing.
Team Members:
Assist with data collection and ensure data integrity.
IT Support:
Ensure digital infrastructure security and perform regular backups.
